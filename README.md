# How to (currently) use the web-client
To use the web client you will have to follow these steps:
- Use the `gid/guild guild id/"guild name"` command
- Use the `cid/channel channel id/"channel name"` command
- Open your web browser and type `localhost:5000` - port configurable in `website.js`
- Then use it all you want
Guild and channel will be saved to config
